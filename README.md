## Versioning

Verde Circle FrontEnd will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions, including new icons, without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
